# Stock Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict NVDA stock prices based on historical data. The model is implemented in Jupyter Notebook using TensorFlow and other popular data science libraries.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses stock price data
- Builds and trains an LSTM model for time series prediction
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted stock prices
- Supports NVIDIA stock data (can be adapted for other stocks)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies:
```powershell
pip install tensorflow pandas matplotlib scikit-learn numpy seaborn
```
